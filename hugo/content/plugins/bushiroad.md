This plugin reads deck codes, automatically retrieves the decklist and fetches card art from Bushiroad, and puts them in the proper `game/` directories.

This plugin supports decklist exports from [Bushiroad Deck Log](https://decklog-en.bushiroad.com/) for the English edition of Cardfight Vanguard, Shadowverse: Evolve, Weiss Schwarz, Godzilla, and hololive. To learn more, see [here](#formats).

## Basic Instructions

Navigate to the root directory as plugins are not meant to be run in the plugins directory.

If you're on macOS or Linux, open **Terminal**. If you're on Windows, open **PowerShell**.

Create and start your virtual Python environment and install Python dependencies if you have not done so already. See [here]({{% ref "../docs/create/#basic-usage" %}}) for more information.

Put your decklist into a text file in `game/decklist`. In this example, the filename is `deck.txt` and the decklist format is Bushiroad Deck Log (`bushiroad`).

Run the script.

```sh
python plugins/bushiroad/fetch.py game/decklist/deck.txt bushiroad_url
```

Now you can create the PDF using [`create_pdf.py`]({{% ref "../docs/create" %}}).

## CLI Options

```
Usage: fetch.py [OPTIONS] DECK_PATH {bushiroad_url}

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

## Formats

### `bushiroad_url`

You can also use a Bushiroad Deck Log URL directly in the command line.
