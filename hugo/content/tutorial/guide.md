Before starting, please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jhsKmAgbXc).

It can be overwhelming to learn how to use the scripts and the cutting machine. After you cut your first set of cards, you'll see it's not so complicated, but it's easy to hit roadblocks starting out. I set up the Discord server to build a community so we can all learn and help each other.

If you get stuck or have questions or just want to learn more before diving in, the best place to get help is in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jhsKmAgbXc).

## Milestones

This lengthy guide is meant to depict a complete picture on how to use cut cards with your Silhouette cutting machine but it may be too much for a newcomer to tackle at once.

If you're starting out, read through the whole guide but work towards the following milestones. Each milestone brings its own challenges so completing them in this order will make the whole process easier.

1) Figure out your cutting settings.
2) Basic cutting:
    * Use plain card stock, not foil or holographic card stock.
    * Ignore printer alignment.
    * Ignore plugins.
    * Learn to generate a PDF and learn to cut it.
3) Double-sided cutting:
    * Figure out your printer offset using the calibration sheet.
    * Learn to apply an offset to your generated PDF.
4) Learn to use the plugins.
5) Learn to cut foil or holographic card stock.

## Prerequisites

### Printer alignment

If you plan on having card backs and if you plan on making double faced cards, then you need to ensure that printer can print with good front and back alignment. Otherwise, your card fronts and backs may have an offset.

Your printer may have built-in tools for calibration and alignment adjustment. However, it doesn't, you can use [`offset_pdf.py`]({{% ref "../docs/offset.md" %}}) to compensate for the printer's offset.

### Cutting settings

Silhouette Studio provides a number of cutting settings to control your cutting machine.

![Cutting settings](/images/cutting_settings.png)

There are 4 main cutting settings:
* **Force** - how hard the machine will push the blade into the material.
* **Speed** - how fast the machine will move the blade.
* **Depth** - how much of the blade the machine will expose.
* **Passes** - how many times the machine will go around a cutting path.

Before starting, you must determine the cutting settings that are best suited for your materials. Failing to do so can result in at best, poorly cut cards or at worse, holes in the your cutting mat.

My recommendations for determining cutting settings:
1) Create a simple cutting template in Silhouette Studio.

![Simple cutting template](/images/cutting_template_simple.png)

2) Click the `Send` tab to show the cutting settings.
3) Set the force, speed, and depth to something reasonable. To start, try 25, 25, and 7.
4) Set passes to 1. By repeating the cutting job, you can determine the required passes.
5) Load your test sheet the press the `Send` button to start the cutting job.
6) When the job finishes, **do not eject** the mat. Lift the corner of the test sheet and check the cut. If the cut is clean, you're done. If not, restart the cutting job as many times as necessary. This will determine required passes.
7) Repeat the entire process. Change the cutting template to cut a different part of your test sheet and experiment with the cutting settings.

Unfortunately, there's no easy way to get around this. You must experiment. You should not copy someone else's settings. Even if we have the same machine, same blade, and same cutting materials, we will need different cutting settings. Learning to adjust cutting settings is a part of using cutting machines.

As a reference, here are my settings for my Cameo 5 with an autoblade and the recommended cardstock and laminate from the [supply list]({{% ref "supplies.md" %}}):
* Force: 35
* Speed: 25
* Depth: 7
* Passes: 4

You can try these settings but you'll likely need to make adjustments for your set up. If you'd like to see settings for other machines and other setups, you can search for them in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jhsKmAgbXc).

Here are some other tips:
* You could use a cutting template from [cutting_templates/](https://github.com/Alan-Cha/silhouette-card-maker/tree/main/cutting_templates) but disable registration marks and cut one card at a time to perform multiple tests per sheet.
* You may be tempted to use max force and/or max speed to cut as quickly as possible. You can try but your machine will likely skip. If your machine skips, power cycle it so it can rehome the tool carriage.
* You may think that increasing depth will help you cut deeper but that's not always true. Depth is just a limit to how deep your machine can cut. Whether your machine can cut up to that limit depends on the other cutting settings.
* To go with the previous point, I would prioritize the cutting settings in the following order: passes, force, speed, and depth. As long as your depth is reasonable, the other cutting settings matter more.
* If the edges of your laminated cards are rippled, try reducing force. This happens when the blade is too dull or the machine is pushing the blade too hard and the lamination is ripped through instead of sliced through.

## Instructions

If you run into any issues, you can get help in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jhsKmAgbXc).

First try searching posts in the `#troubleshooting` channel. There are hundreds of resolved post so it's likely that someone has already encountered your problem and fixed it.

If you still need help, create a new post in the `#troubleshooting` channel and include photos and videos.

### Set up environment

[Install Silhouette Studio](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/silhouette-studio).

Download the Silhouette Card Maker code by clicking [here](https://github.com/Alan-Cha/silhouette-card-maker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Unzip the code if necessary. You can also clone the repo [here](https://github.com/Alan-Cha/silhouette-card-maker) if you know how.

### Check if Python is installed

If you're on macOS or Linux, open **Terminal**. If you're on Windows, open **PowerShell**.

Then copy and paste the following into Terminal or Powershell.

```sh
python --version
```

The command should display the Python version installed on your computer.

If the command does not work, try replacing `python` with `python3`.

If you don't have Python installed, install it by clicking [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In the installer, check the box to **"Add python.exe to PATH"**.

![Python installer](/images/python_installer.png)

After installing Python, close Terminal or Powershell, reopen it, and verify again.

### Upgrade pip

Pip is the package manager for Python. It is used to help install the tools needed for Silhouette Card Maker to work.

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Navigate to the code

In Terminal and Powershell, the commands you run depend on which directory you are currently in. When you start Terminal and Powershell, you start off in your home directory.

For Silhouette Card Maker to work, you need to go to the directory where the code is downloaded. In the following command, replace `<path to the code>` with the file path to the code.

```sh
cd <path to the code>
```

> [!TIP]
> For example, if you unzipped the code in the `Downloads` folder, then use the following:
>
> ```sh
> cd Downloads/silhouette-card-maker-main/silhouette-card-maker-main
> ```

### Create a Python virtual environment

A virtual environment ensures that the Python packages you will install in the next step will not affect the rest of your computer.

Create a new virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

Then, activate the environment:

{{< tabs items="macOS/Linux,Windows" defaultIndex="0" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
```sh
. venv/bin/activate
```
  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab >}}
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

> [!TIP]
> If you see a **security error**, run the following, then try activating the environment again.
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
> ```
  {{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

You will know if the virtual environment has been activated when `(venv)` appears in the prompt.

### Install Python packages

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create the PDF

Put card front images into the `game/front/` folder. Then, put a card back image into the `game/back/` folder.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the game, Zero sumZ, as an example. Simply move the [game assets](https://github.com/Alan-Cha/silhouette-card-maker/tree/main/examples/ZERO%20SUMZ) to the appropriate image folders.
>
> You can also use a [plugin]({{% ref "../plugins" %}}) to populate the image folders. Many games, including [Magic: The Gathering]({{% ref "../plugins/mtg.md" %}}), [Pokemon]({{% ref "../plugins/pokemon.md" %}}), [Yu-Gi-Oh!]({{% ref "../plugins/yugioh.md" %}}), [Riftbound]({{% ref "../plugins/riftbound.md" %}}), [One Piece]({{% ref "../plugins/one_piece.md" %}}), and [Lorcana]({{% ref "../plugins/lorcana.md" %}}), are currently supported.

Generate the PDF with the following:

{{< tabs items="Letter size paper,A4 size paper" defaultIndex="0" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
```sh
python create_pdf.py
```

This will create a PDF for `letter` paper size and `standard` card size. The default `standard` card size is appropriate for most TCGs.
  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab >}}
```sh
python create_pdf.py --paper_size a4
```

This will create a PDF for `a4` paper size and `standard` card size. The default `standard` card size is appropriate for most TCGs.
  {{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

> [!TIP]
> `create_pdf.py` supports many **paper and card sizes** such as `poker`, `bridge`, `tarot`, and even `business` cards. To see all paper and card sizes, see [here](https://alan-cha.github.io/silhouette-card-maker/#supported-sizes).
>
> `create_pdf.py` offers many options including creating **double-sided cards**. To learn more, see [here]({{% ref "../docs/create.md" %}}).

You can find the PDF in `game/output/game.pdf` and it should look similar to the following:

![PDF output](/images/create_pdf.png)

### Prepare the sheets

Print the PDF with `actual size` scale. Ensure the print **exactly matches** the PDF and pay close attention to the white margins. If the print does not match, your cards will be the wrong size or registration will fail entirely.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using duplex printing (double-sided printing), make sure to use **long side flip** (also called "flip on long edge"). This ensures the backs align correctly with the fronts.

![Print](/images/lamination.jpg)

Laminate the sheets. Because cardstock is thicker than printer paper, you may need to use a **higher setting** on your laminator. If not, you could have cloudy lamination or delamination issues.

For example, even though I use 3 mil lamination pouches, I use the 5 mil setting on my laminator.

![Into the lamination pouch](/images/lamination2.jpg)
![Into the laminator](/images/lamination3.jpg)

### Cut the sheets

Open the appropriate cutting template in Silhouette Studio. Cutting templates are found in the [`cutting_templates/`](https://github.com/Alan-Cha/silhouette-card-maker/tree/main/cutting_templates) folder.

The cutting template you should use depends on the paper and card sizes you used during PDF generation. If you are unsure, the appropriate cutting template is printed on the PDF.

![Cutting template](/images/cutting_template_standard.png)

Ensure that your machine is selected.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a **Cameo 5 Alpha**, select **Cameo 5** instead.
>
> The Cameo 5 Alpha uses the new 4 corner registration marks. If you followed the tutorial, you generated a PDF with the old 3 corner registration marks. The Cameo 5 Alpha can still use the old registration marks by changing the machine to Cameo 5.
>
> While `create_pdf.py` can generate a PDF using the new registration marks, most Cameo 5 Alpha users still prefer the old registration marks for reliability.

![Select machine](/images/select_machine.png)
![Select machine](/images/select_machine2.png)

Put a sheet on the cutting mat. The position of the sheet should match what is depicted in Silhouette Studio.

For this cutting template, the sheet should be in the **top left of the cutting mat grid** and the **black registration square should be in the top left** as well.

![Notice the grid](/images/sheet_placement.jpg)

Align the sheet to the grid using the edges of the paper, not the edges of the lamination.

![Notice the black square](/images/sheet_placement2.jpg)

Use a Post-It note to **cover the bottom left card**.

Because the card is so close to the bottom left L registration mark, the machine can get the two confused. Covering the card will reduce registration issues.

You can also use masking tape or a piece of paper with tape on it, as long as whatever you use is **lightly colored** and closely matches the paper.

![Bottom left card](/images/registration_fix.jpg)
![Bottom left card covered](/images/registration_fix2.jpg)

The machine's pinch rollers grip and move the mat. Ensure that they are set to the right position for your mat.

![Pinch roller](/images/pinch_roller.jpg)
![Pinch roller close up](/images/pinch_roller2.jpg)

Insert the mat into the machine. The left edge of the mat should be aligned with the notch on the machine. 

![Notch](/images/mat_placement.jpg)
![Mat touching notch](/images/mat_placement2.jpg)
![Notch close up](/images/mat_placement_close.jpg)
![Mat touching notch close up](/images/mat_placement_close2.jpg)

Click the media load button on the machine. The pinch rollers should pull the mat into the machine on both sides of the mat.

Put your [cutting settings](#cutting-settings) into Silhouette Studio.

> [!TIP]
> You can save your cutting settings as a "New material" in Silhouette Studio.

![Cutting settings](/images/cutting_template_settings.png)

Click "Send" to start the cutting job. Remove the Post-It note after registration but before cutting.

![Starting job](/images/starting_job.jpg)

### Finish the cards

Click the media eject button on the machine to remove the mat.

Peel off the cards and remove the excess.

![Cut cards](/images/peel.jpg)
![The peel](/images/peel2.jpg)
![Free cards](/images/peel3.jpg)

Because the cutting process can cause the card edges to delaminate, put the cards through the laminator a second time.

![Relaminating](/images/relamination.jpg)

Now you're ready to play with your cards!

### What about next time?

Some of the steps shown during the PDF generation are one-time set up.

In the future, simply do the following:

{{< tabs items="macOS/Linux,Windows" defaultIndex="0" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
1) Open Terminal.
2) Navigate to the code.
3) Start the virtual environment.
4) Generate the PDF.

```sh
cd <path to code>
. venv/bin/activate
python create_pdf.py
```
  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab >}}
1) Open Powershell.
2) If necessary, run the following to stop security errors.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```

3) Navigate to the code.
4) Start the virtual environment.
5) Generate the PDF.

```powershell
cd <path to code>
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python create_pdf.py
```
  {{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

Then print, laminate, and cut with your machine!

## Next Steps

Share your success in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jhsKmAgbXc)! While you're there, go to the `Channels & Roles` tab and claim the `SCM Graduate` role for completing the tutorial! Share pictures in `#photo-showcase` as well!

As mentioned, `create_pdf.py` offers many [configuration options]({{% ref "../docs/create.md" %}}). For example, `create_pdf.py` can make double-sided cards, use different paper sizes, cut various card sizes, and more! Explore some of these options.

If you're interested in making proxies for TCGs, try using a [plugin]({{% ref "../plugins" %}}). Currently, Silhouette Card Maker has support for many games including [Magic: The Gathering]({{% ref "../plugins/mtg.md" %}}), [Pokemon]({{% ref "../plugins/pokemon.md" %}}), [Yu-Gi-Oh!]({{% ref "../plugins/yugioh.md" %}}), [Riftbound]({{% ref "../plugins/riftbound.md" %}}), [One Piece]({{% ref "../plugins/one_piece.md" %}}), and [Lorcana]({{% ref "../plugins/lorcana.md" %}}). All you need to do is provide a decklist and the plugin will automatically fetch the images for you!

Thanks and have fun cutting cards!
